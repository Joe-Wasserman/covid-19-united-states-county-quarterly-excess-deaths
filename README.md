COVID-19 United States Excess Deaths by county and quarter
================

This repository contains code and data to estimate **expected deaths**
and **excess deaths** in the United States in 2020 by **county** and
**quarter**.

Estimated excess deaths are available at
[`/blob/main/results/united_states_county_quarterly_excess_deaths_estimates.csv`](https://github.com/mymil/covid-19-united-states-county-quarterly-excess-deaths/blob/main/results/united_states_county_quarterly_excess_deaths_estimates.csv).

# Data Sources

-   CDC WONDER all-cause, all-ages deaths by county and month

    <https://wonder.cdc.gov/ucd-icd10.html>

    These public-use historical mortality data were obtained for years
    2015-2019 and used to estimate the expected deaths model. Because
    these data have an unusual and specific license, they are not
    included as part of the repository, but can be freely downloaded
    from <https://wonder.cdc.gov/ucd-icd10.html>.

    Note: County-months wither fewer than 10 deaths are censored in the
    source data.

-   NCHS Provisional COVID-19 Deaths by Quarter, County and Age for 2020

    <https://data.cdc.gov/NCHS/AH-Provisional-COVID-19-Deaths-by-Quarter-County-a/ypxr-mz8e>

    These public domain all-cause and COVID-19 mortality data were
    obtained for 2020 and compared to estimated expected deaths to
    calculate excess deaths. The age groups in these data are not
    mutually exclusive. To minimize the prevalence of suppression in
    these data, values from the two widest age groups, under 65 and 65
    and older, were summed.

    Note: Values for county-quarter-age group with fewer than 9 deaths
    are suppressed.

-   US Census Population Estimates

    Population estimates for 2015-2019 were retrieved from the [US
    Census Bureau Population Estimates
    API](https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets/popest-popproj.html)
    via the [tidycensus](https://github.com/walkerke/tidycensus) R
    package. Population estimates for 2019 were filled forward for 2020.

    Note: This product uses the Census Bureau Data API but is not
    endorsed or certified by the Census Bureau.

# Excess Deaths Model

The excess deaths model used began as an adaptation of *The Economist*â€™s
[excess mortality
model](https://github.com/TheEconomist/covid-19-excess-deaths-tracker),
but has since diverged.

Given the large number of counties in the United States (over 3000), a
linear mixed model with county as a random grouping factor was used to
make estimation tractable. This random grouping factor enables every
county to have its own intercept in the final model.

More precisely, the model regresses **total deaths per day** on:

-   county population (z-scored)

-   years since 2015

-   quarter of the year (fixed grouping factor)

-   county (random grouping factor)

This model can be expressed by the equation:

# Model Performance

Because the COVID-19 pandemic only began partway through March, 2020, we
can evaluate model performance by examining concordance of predicted and
observed deaths in Q1 2020.

Observed and expected deaths in Q1 2020 are highly correlated, r =
0.998. As can be seen from the following scatterplot, total deaths
(x-axis) tended to exceed expected deaths (y-axis). Unsurprisingly, some
of the counties that were hardest hit early in the pandemic are among
those with total deaths that most diverge from expected deaths.
